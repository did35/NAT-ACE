# The Impact of Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and Reduced Sulphur Emissions on Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) in the North Atlantic Ocean

The Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) *[1](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2018/09/how-does-a-river-plume-influence-hurricanes-in-the-caribbean.html)* - *[2](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/53/2/JPO-D-21-0235.1.xml)*, significantly influenced by freshwater plumes from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, plays a crucial role in maintaining high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) by preventing vertical mixing of the ocean’s layers. This warm, stable surface layer provides the necessary heat and energy for hurricanes to develop and intensify rapidly. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) *[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy)* measures the total energy of tropical cyclones, calculated from their wind speeds and duration. Additionally, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) *[4](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/faq/amo_faq.php)*, a climate cycle affecting SSTs in the North Atlantic over periods of about 60 to 70 years, further modulates hurricane activity. Positive phases of the AMO, characterized by warmer SSTs, enhance the effects of BLT, leading to higher ACE values and more intense hurricane seasons. 

Furthermore, recent reductions in sulfur emissions from shipping, mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) *[5](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/34-IMO-2020-sulphur-limit-.aspx)* to improve air quality, have inadvertently decreased the reflective sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, resulting in increased solar radiation absorption by the oceans and contributing to higher SSTs *[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3)*. 

While these factors are part of a complex system influencing SST and hurricane activity, my research aims to understand their combined impact on ACE in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is important to note that there are many interacting variables in climate systems, and this post highlights some of the contributing factors under study.
## Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)

Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a metric used to compare overall activity of tropical cyclones, utilizing the available records of windspeeds at six-hour intervals to synthesize storm duration and strength into a single index value. The ACE index may refer to a single storm or to groups of storms such as those within a particular month, a full season or combined seasons. It is calculated by summing the square of tropical cyclones' maximum sustained winds, as recorded every six hours, but only for windspeeds of at least tropical storm strength (≥ 34 kn; 63 km/h; 39 mph); the resulting figure is divided by 10,000 to place it on a more manageable scale.


## Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)

The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a climate phenomenon characterized by long-term fluctuations in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North Atlantic, occurring over periods of 60 to 70 years. It alternates between warm and cool phases, each lasting several decades and significantly impacting climate and weather patterns.

**Warm Phase:**
- Increased hurricane activity due to warmer SSTs.
- Warmer and wetter conditions in parts of North America and Europe.
- Changes in marine ecosystems affecting fish populations.

**Cool Phase:**
- Decreased hurricane activity due to cooler SSTs.
- Cooler and drier conditions in affected regions.
- Shifts in marine ecosystems as species adapt to changing temperatures.

The AMO is driven by factors such as variations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), fluctuations in solar radiation, and volcanic activity. Its influence extends globally, affecting weather patterns, droughts, precipitation, and temperature anomalies. Understanding and monitoring the AMO is essential for predicting future climate conditions and assessing the impacts of climate change.
## Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT)

### Oceanography

In oceanography, the Barrier Layer Thickness refers to the layer in the ocean where the temperature changes rapidly with depth, forming a barrier that affects the mixing of the ocean's surface waters with deeper layers. This layer is part of the upper ocean and lies between the mixed layer and the thermocline. Here are some key points:

1. **Formation and Location**:
   - The barrier layer is formed due to differences in salinity and temperature in the upper ocean.
   - It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where there is significant rainfall, river runoff, or where ocean currents converge.

2. **Importance**:
   - The barrier layer plays a crucial role in regulating sea surface temperatures and thus has a significant impact on weather and climate patterns.
   - It influences the exchange of heat and gases between the ocean and atmosphere, affecting phenomena like El Niño and La Niña.
   - The thickness of the barrier layer can impact marine life by influencing nutrient distribution and light penetration.

3. **Measurement**:
   - BLT is measured using oceanographic instruments like CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) sensors, ARGO floats, and remote sensing technology.
   - It is defined as the depth difference between the mixed layer depth and the isothermal layer depth.



### Summary

- **Oceanography**: BLT impacts climate and marine ecosystems, formed due to salinity and temperature variations.

Understanding and controlling BLT is crucial for advancing our knowledge of ocean dynamics and improving material performance in industrial applications.
## Role of BLT in Hurricane Development

Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) can influence the development and intensification of storms, including hurricanes. Here’s how it works:

### Role of BLT in Hurricane Development

1. **Thermal Regulation**:
   - The barrier layer helps maintain a warm surface temperature in the ocean. Warm water is a critical energy source for hurricanes. When a thick barrier layer is present, it can trap heat in the upper ocean, providing a sustained source of warmth.
   - This warm water fuels the hurricane, allowing it to grow stronger and more intense.

2. **Reduced Mixing**:
   - The barrier layer inhibits vertical mixing between the warm surface waters and the cooler waters below. This prevents the cooling of surface waters, which can occur during a hurricane due to the churning of the ocean.
   - Without significant cooling, the hurricane continues to draw energy from the warm surface waters, which can lead to rapid intensification.

3. **Stabilization of Upper Ocean**:
   - The presence of a barrier layer stabilizes the upper ocean structure, maintaining a favorable environment for hurricane development.
   - Stable conditions in the upper ocean contribute to the organized convection and circulation patterns needed for a hurricane to develop and intensify.

### Case Studies and Observations

- **Historical Hurricanes**:
  - Observations of past hurricanes have shown that those passing over regions with a thick barrier layer often intensify more quickly. For example, hurricanes in the Atlantic that pass over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, where a barrier layer is often present, tend to strengthen rapidly.

- **Impact on Forecasting**:
  - Understanding the presence and characteristics of the barrier layer can improve hurricane intensity forecasts. Meteorologists and oceanographers monitor BLT using satellite data, ocean buoys, and ARGO floats to predict potential rapid intensification events.

### Implications for Climate and Weather Patterns

- **Climate Change**:
  - With climate change, ocean temperatures are rising, potentially altering the formation and thickness of barrier layers in various regions. This could influence the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other tropical storms.
  - Increased freshwater input from melting ice and increased precipitation can also impact barrier layer formation, further affecting storm dynamics.

### Summary

The barrier layer thickness (BLT) plays a significant role in hurricane development by maintaining warm surface waters, reducing vertical mixing, and stabilizing the upper ocean. These factors contribute to the rapid intensification of hurricanes, making BLT an important parameter in understanding and predicting these powerful storms.
## Influence of Amazon and Orinoco Rivers on BLT

Both the Amazon and Orinoco rivers can significantly influence the Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) in the regions where their waters discharge into the ocean. Here’s how they contribute to changes in BLT:

### Influence of Amazon and Orinoco Rivers on BLT

1. **Freshwater Input**:
   - Both rivers discharge large volumes of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean. This influx of freshwater reduces the salinity of the surface waters, which is a critical factor in the formation of a barrier layer.
   - The lower salinity at the surface creates a density difference between the surface layer and the deeper, saltier waters. This density difference can lead to the formation of a barrier layer, inhibiting vertical mixing.

2. **Formation of a Strong Halocline**:
   - The halocline is a layer within the ocean where there is a rapid change in salinity with depth. The freshwater input from the Amazon and Orinoco enhances the halocline, contributing to the formation and maintenance of the barrier layer.
   - The stronger the halocline, the more effective it is at preventing the mixing of the warm surface waters with the cooler, deeper waters.

3. **Thermal Impact**:
   - The freshwater input can also influence the thermal structure of the ocean. The surface waters warmed by the sun tend to remain on top of the denser, saltier layers, maintaining higher sea surface temperatures.
   - This retention of heat in the upper layers of the ocean can contribute to the conditions favorable for tropical storm development and intensification.

### Regional Effects

1. **Amazon River**:
   - The Amazon River discharges an immense volume of freshwater into the Atlantic, affecting a large area of the western tropical Atlantic Ocean.
   - This discharge creates a significant barrier layer, particularly noticeable in the Amazon plume area, extending several hundred kilometers offshore.

2. **Orinoco River**:
   - The Orinoco River, while smaller than the Amazon, still discharges a substantial amount of freshwater into the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.
   - The plume from the Orinoco can similarly create and enhance a barrier layer in its discharge region, contributing to higher sea surface temperatures and potentially influencing storm development in the Caribbean and adjacent Atlantic regions.

### Implications for Hurricanes and Climate

- **Hurricane Intensification**:
  - Regions affected by the freshwater plumes of these rivers often have conditions that can lead to the rapid intensification of hurricanes. The warm, stratified surface waters provide ample energy for storm development.
  - Historical data show that hurricanes passing over these regions can intensify quickly, drawing energy from the warm, less saline surface waters maintained by the barrier layer.

- **Climate Variability**:
  - Seasonal variations in river discharge, driven by precipitation patterns in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, can lead to changes in the extent and impact of the barrier layer.
  - Understanding these variations is crucial for improving weather and climate models, particularly in predicting the formation and intensification of tropical storms and hurricanes.

### Summary

The Amazon and Orinoco rivers significantly influence the Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea by injecting large volumes of freshwater, which lowers surface salinity, enhances the halocline, and maintains warm surface temperatures. These conditions are conducive to the rapid intensification of hurricanes, making the study of these river plumes essential for better forecasting and understanding of tropical storm dynamics.
## Temperature and Salinity Dynamics

It's a reasonable assumption that river water might be cooler than ocean water, but the dynamics in the tropics and the specific characteristics of river plumes can create different conditions. Let's clarify how the Amazon and Orinoco river plumes influence the Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) and the conditions favorable for hurricane development.

### Temperature and Salinity Dynamics

1. **Temperature**:
   - **River Plume Temperature**: In the tropics, the water from rivers like the Amazon and Orinoco is often warm due to the high ambient temperatures in these regions. The rivers flow through warm climates and pick up heat from the land and atmosphere.
   - **Ocean Temperature**: While the surface ocean water in the Caribbean is also warm, the key factor here is the relative warmth and stratification induced by the river plumes. The freshwater input can sometimes be slightly cooler, but it's typically not drastically different in temperature from the ocean surface water in these regions.

2. **Salinity and Stratification**:
   - **Lower Salinity**: The freshwater from the rivers is much less saline than the ocean water. When it enters the ocean, it forms a less dense layer on top of the saltier (and denser) ocean water.
   - **Formation of Barrier Layer**: This stratification, where a warm, low-salinity layer overlays the saltier ocean water, creates a strong barrier layer that inhibits vertical mixing.

### Effects on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and BLT

- **Warm Surface Layer**: Because the freshwater plume is less dense, it stays on the surface, where it is heated by the sun. This process can lead to higher sea surface temperatures because the heat is trapped in the upper layer.
- **Enhanced Barrier Layer**: The reduced salinity and temperature stratification prevent the mixing of this warm surface layer with cooler, deeper waters. This enhanced barrier layer retains heat at the surface.

### Implications for Hurricane Development

1. **Sustained Warm SSTs**:
   - Warm SSTs are crucial for hurricane development as they provide the energy needed for the storm to intensify. The warm, stratified layer created by the river plume helps maintain these high SSTs.
   
2. **Energy Source for Hurricanes**:
   - Hurricanes derive their energy from the heat and moisture of the ocean surface. The presence of a barrier layer ensures a steady supply of warm water, aiding in the rapid intensification of storms.
   
3. **Case Studies**:
   - Historical data and studies have shown that regions influenced by the Amazon and Orinoco plumes often see rapid intensification of hurricanes due to these warm, stratified conditions.

### Summary

- **Warm Freshwater Plumes**: The freshwater plumes from the Amazon and Orinoco are typically warm, given the tropical climate.
- **Stratification and Barrier Layer**: These plumes create a low-salinity, warm surface layer that inhibits vertical mixing, forming a barrier layer.
- **Sustained Warm SSTs**: The barrier layer helps maintain high sea surface temperatures, providing energy for hurricane development.

The net effect is that these river plumes contribute to conditions that can lead to the rapid intensification of hurricanes, despite any initial temperature differences between the river water and ocean water. The overall impact is driven by the creation of a stable, warm, and less saline surface layer that is conducive to storm intensification.
## Salinity and Its Role

Salinity is the key factor when it comes to understanding the influence of river plumes from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers on the Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) and the conditions favorable for hurricane development. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

### Salinity and Its Role

1. **Density Differences**:
   - Salinity affects the density of seawater. Freshwater from rivers has much lower salinity compared to seawater, making it less dense.
   - When this low-salinity river water enters the ocean, it remains on top of the denser, saltier water, creating a distinct stratification.

2. **Barrier Layer Formation**:
   - This stratification forms a barrier layer, where the fresher, less dense water overlays the saltier, denser water.
   - The barrier layer inhibits vertical mixing, preventing the cooler, deeper water from mixing with the warmer surface water.

3. **Thermal Effects**:
   - The presence of the barrier layer allows the surface layer to retain heat more effectively because it reduces the exchange of heat with the deeper, cooler water.
   - This results in higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which are crucial for the development and intensification of hurricanes.

### Influence of River Plumes

1. **Amazon and Orinoco River Plumes**:
   - These rivers discharge large volumes of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean, significantly reducing the salinity in their discharge regions.
   - The freshwater plumes extend over large areas and contribute to the formation of a pronounced barrier layer.

2. **Enhanced SSTs**:
   - The stratified layer of warm, low-salinity water maintains higher SSTs because the barrier layer prevents the mixing of warm surface water with the cooler water below.
   - Warm SSTs are a critical energy source for hurricanes, providing the heat and moisture necessary for storm intensification.

### Case Studies and Observations

- **Historical Hurricanes**:
  - Observations and studies have shown that hurricanes passing over regions influenced by the Amazon and Orinoco river plumes often experience rapid intensification due to the warm, stratified surface waters.
  
### Summary

- **Key Role of Salinity**: The primary influence of river plumes on the Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT) and hurricane development is through the reduction of salinity, which creates a stratified layer of warm, low-salinity water on the ocean surface.
- **Barrier Layer**: This barrier layer inhibits vertical mixing, maintaining high SSTs and providing favorable conditions for hurricane intensification.
- **Warm SSTs and Hurricanes**: The warm surface waters sustained by the barrier layer serve as a critical energy source for hurricanes, leading to their rapid development and intensification.

Understanding the role of salinity in the formation of the barrier layer and its impact on sea surface temperatures is essential for predicting and studying hurricane behavior in regions influenced by large river plumes.
## Seasonal Variation in River Plumes

The intensity and extent of river plumes from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers can vary seasonally, influenced by rainfall patterns and river discharge rates. Here’s how it typically works:

### Seasonal Variation in River Plumes

1. **Rainfall and Discharge**:
   - Both the Amazon and Orinoco river basins experience seasonal variations in rainfall, which directly affect river discharge.
   - The Amazon basin typically receives the most rainfall during the wet season, which can vary slightly but generally occurs from December to May. The peak discharge into the Atlantic often follows, usually peaking around April to June.
   - Similarly, the Orinoco River has a rainy season from May to November, with peak discharge typically occurring in July and August.

2. **Impact on Plumes**:
   - During periods of high discharge, the river plumes are more extensive and pronounced due to the increased volume of freshwater entering the ocean.
   - In June, the Amazon River discharge is still relatively high following its peak, contributing to a significant plume. The Orinoco River is beginning to ramp up towards its peak discharge in the subsequent months.

### June Plume Characteristics

- **Amazon River**:
  - In June, the Amazon River plume is usually extensive, following the high discharge period in April and May. The large volume of freshwater creates a substantial low-salinity layer on the ocean surface.
  
- **Orinoco River**:
  - The Orinoco River is in the early stages of its peak discharge period in June, leading to a growing plume that becomes more pronounced in July and August.

### Summary

In June, the river plumes from the Amazon are typically quite extensive due to the high discharge from the preceding months. The Orinoco plume is starting to intensify as it approaches its peak discharge in the following months. These conditions contribute to the formation of a significant barrier layer, influencing sea surface temperatures and potentially aiding in the development and intensification of hurricanes.
## Impact of the abrupt reduction in shipping emissions

Tianle Yuan and colleagues *[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3)*, addresses the impact of the abrupt reduction in shipping emissions on radiative forcing and climate. The title of the paper is "Abrupt reduction in shipping emissions as an inadvertent geo-engineering termination shock produces substantial radiative warming." 

**Here are some key points about the paper**:

### Background
- **IMO 2020 Regulation**: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented a regulation starting in January 2020 that required a significant reduction in the sulfur content of shipping fuels - *[5](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/34-IMO-2020-sulphur-limit-.aspx)*. This change aimed to reduce air pollution and associated health problems but also had climate implications.

### Key Findings
- **Reduction in Sulfate Aerosols**: Sulfur compounds in ship emissions lead to the formation of sulfate aerosols, which have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight back into space. The reduction in sulfur emissions due to the IMO 2020 regulation led to a decrease in these sulfate aerosols.
  
- **Radiative Forcing Estimate**: The paper estimates that the reduction in shipping emissions resulted in a radiative forcing of 0.2 to 0.11 Wm^-2. Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth's atmosphere system. Positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface, while negative radiative forcing tends to cool it.

- **Inadvertent Geo-engineering**: The term "inadvertent geo-engineering termination shock" in the title refers to the unintended consequences of abruptly stopping an activity (in this case, the emission of sulfur compounds from ships) that had been inadvertently cooling the planet. The sudden reduction in these cooling aerosols led to an abrupt warming.

### Implications
- **Substantial Warming**: The reduction in sulfate aerosols due to decreased sulfur emissions led to an increase in radiative forcing, which translates to a warming effect. This suggests that while reducing sulfur emissions is beneficial for air quality and human health, it has the side effect of reducing a cooling influence on the climate, thus contributing to global warming.

- **Policy and Climate Impact**: This study highlights the complex interactions between pollution control measures and climate change. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to environmental policy that considers both the immediate benefits of reducing pollutants and the long-term implications for climate change.

### Conclusion
The paper by Tianle Yuan and colleagues provides important insights into the unintended climate effects of reducing shipping emissions. The estimated radiative forcing of 0.2 to 0.11 Wm^-2 due to the reduction in sulfate aerosols emphasizes the need to carefully consider the climatic impacts of air quality regulations. While the reduction in sulfur emissions improves air quality and public health, it also reduces the cooling effect of sulfate aerosols, contributing to a net warming of the planet. This finding is critical for policymakers and climate scientists working to balance the goals of pollution reduction and climate mitigation.

## Acknowledgements

I acknowledge that this is a controversial topic, particularly as mainstream discussions often focus on human causes of climate change. However, my research tends to focus on natural causes and their significant roles in influencing climate and weather patterns. While these factors are part of a complex system influencing SST and hurricane activity, my goal is to understand their combined impact on ACE in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The ENSO influence and the Hunga Tonga marine volcano eruption that erupted in January 2022 are not part of this study but could be integrated for future understanding of this complex non-linear chaotic system *[7](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar3/wg1/)*.
